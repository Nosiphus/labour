			<p><b>Wednesday, March 21, 2018 - False Pretenses - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>Fifteen years ago, George Bush and Tony Blair launched a knowingly illegal war on false pretenses. It was the greatest crime of the 21st century. Yet today, the perpetrators are still at large. How the hell can the United States or Britain call themselves the arsenals of democracy when the two biggest war criminals and human rights abusers alive are allowed to live freely while the at least 200,000 Iraqis who perished in the war are not? That war was premeditated in order to plunder Iraq for its oil resources. In addition, they purposefully destabilized the region in order to drive up terrorism, which allowed them to abuse people’s fear to grow the surveillance state. We live in the world of 1984. People just prefer to ignore it.</p>
