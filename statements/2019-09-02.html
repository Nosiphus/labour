					<b>Monday, September 2, 2019 - Labor Day - Sean Crain</b>
				
				</p>
				
				<div class="p">

						Labor Day is a holiday of, by, and for the working class. Unions are what built the middle class. During the middle of the twentieth century, unionization rates peaked at 35%, and that's when people did make enough money to live quite comfortably on one job.<br><br>
						
						
						The forty-year war on the working class had a primary goal of stripping unions of their power, and unionization rates have collapsed. No big surprises to see that while productivity gains have continued to rise, wages have not kept up since 1981.<br><br>
						
						
						In Scandinavian countries like Sweden, the unionization rate is in the 80% range. Just take a look at their quality of life, and you'll see just how much of an impact collective bargaining has on the general populace.<br><br>
						
						
						We need to strengthen the union movement again, and it needs to be far more powerful that it ever was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s. That's the only way this economy will ever turn around for the working men and women of this nation.<br><br>
						
						
						Happy Labor Day.
