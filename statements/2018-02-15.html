			<p><b>Thursday, February 15, 2018 - Parkland Response - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>After the Port Arthur shooting in 1996, Australia enacted strict gun control laws and confiscated assault weapons. They haven’t had a single mass shooting since. That’s what we should do. The U.S. and Australia both have rugged individualism, and are both former British colonies that committed genocide of native inhabitants. We’re not all that different.</p>
			
			<p>Those of you complaining about criminals getting weapons, here’s an idea: fix the root causes of crime. Making drugs legal would eliminate large portions of this violence, and lifting people out of poverty by forcing the ultra-rich to pay 91% of their income in taxes like they did in the 1950s would be tremendously helpful.</p>
