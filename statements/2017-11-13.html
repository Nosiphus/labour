					<p>
					
						We are here at a press conference held by Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the Senate seat who is under sexual misconduct allegations. Sir, what do you plead?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>Nothing to be guilty of.</i> (Guilty - Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb)<br><br>
						
						
						
						But sir, there have been multiple accusations against you, what do you say to that?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>Jive talkin', tellin' me lies</i> (Jive Talkin' - Bee Gees)<br><br>
						
						
						
						Can you at least explain why they're claiming this?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>I can't tell you why.</i> (I Can't Tell You Why - Eagles)<br><br>
						
						
						
						We are now speaking with a woman who claims to have been assaulted by Roy Moore. Ma'am, they say Moore is going to beat these charges. What do you say to that?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>Say it isn't so!</i> (Say It Isn't So - Daryl Hall & John Oates)<br><br>
						
						
						
						It's been two weeks and it has now been confirmed that the events detailed by the women did indeed occur. How were you able to evade charges for so long?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>I get by with a little help from my friends.</i> (With A Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles)<br><br>
						
						
						
						What did you think whenever you saw them?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>Well, she was just seventeen. Do you know what I mean? And the way she looked was way beyond compare!</i> (I Saw Her Standing There - The Beatles)<br><br>
						
						
						
						What did you tell her?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>And when I touch you I feel happy inside.</i> (I Want To Hold Your Hand - The Beatles)<br><br>
						
						
						
						What did she say to you?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>I can't go for that, no, no, no can do.</i> (I Can't For That (No Can Do)) - Hall & Oates<br><br>
						
						
						
						And what did she say when you continued to harass her?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>Help! I need somebody!</i> (Help! - The Beatles)<br><br>
						
						
						
						When did this happen?<br><br>
						
						
						
						<i>It was twenty years ago today.</i> (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles)
