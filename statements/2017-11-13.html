			<p><b>Monday, November 13, 2017 - Making Fun of Roy Moore, Dicky Goodman style - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>We are here at a press conference held by Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the Senate seat who is under sexual misconduct allegations. Sir, what do you plead?</p>
			
			<p><em>Nothing to be guilty of.</em> (Guilty - Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb)</p>
			
			<p>But sir, there have been multiple accusations against you, what do you say to that?</p>
			
			<p><em>Jive talking, telling me lies</em> (Jive Talkin’ - Bee Gees)</p>
			
			<p>Can you at least explain why they’re claiming this?</p>
			
			<p><em>I can’t tell you why.</em> (I Can’t Tell You Why - Eagles)</p>
			
			<p>We are now speaking with a woman who claims to have been assaulted by Roy Moore. Ma’am, they say Moore is going to beat these charges. What do you say to that?</p>
			
			<p><em>Say it isn’t so!</em> (Say It Isn’t So - Hall & Oates)</p>
			
			<p>It’s been two weeks and it has now been confirmed that the events detailed by the women did indeed occur. How were you able to evade charges for so long?</p>
			
			<p><em>I get by with a little help from my friends.</em> (With A Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles)</p>
			
			<p>What did you think whenever you saw them?</p>
			
			<p><em>Well, she was just seventeen. Do you know what I mean? And the way she looked was way beyond compare!</em> (I Saw Her Standing There - The Beatles)</p>
			
			<p>What did you tell her?</p>
			
			<p><em>And when I touch you I feel happy inside.</em> (I Want To Hold Your Hand - The Beatles)</p>
			
			<p>What did she say to you?</p>
			
			<p><em>I can’t go for that, no, no, no can do</em> (I Can’t Go For That - Hall & Oates)</p>
			
			<p>And what did she say when you continued to harass her?</p>
			
			<p><em>Help! I need somebody!</em> (Help! - The Beatles)</p>
			
			<p>When did this happen?</p>
			
			<p><em>It was twenty years ago today.</em> (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles)</p>
