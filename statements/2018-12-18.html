						Conservatives love to scream about how California is a left-wing hellhole filled with potheads, faggots, and devil worshippers, and they can’t wrap their heads around why they can’t see the greatness of the countryside and Christianity.<br><br>
						
						
						At the same time, liberals see middle America as a reactionary relic of a bygone area filled with Bible-thumpers clinging to a world that no longer exists, and don’t understand why they can’t see through religion as the dogmatic bullshit it is.<br><br>
						
						
						This divide is why the country is so polarized. Take a look at the statements I’ve made, the generalizations. What do you see? Rural conservative Christians against Urban liberal secularists. Rural conservatives vs. Urban liberals.<br><br>
						
						
						Are you seeing it now? If you haven’t, think about this. When you visit some of your relatives, think of the morals they live by, and how they live, but more importantly, look at where they live. It’s a divide that’s existed in American politics since the very beginning.<br><br>
						
						
						Urban vs. Rural.<br><br>
						
						
						In the 1950s and 1960s, big cities and small towns were different, but each had different opportunities. Big cities were the home of industry, finance, where people made a name for themselves, if they were lucky.<br><br>
						
						
						Small towns were a place where you knew everybody, everyone worked around the same place, the railroad, the steel mill, the automotive factory. Stores popped up around the industry, and so did people. It was wonderful.<br><br>
						
						
						Then, the 1970s arrived, and both began to suffer. In cities, urban decay began to infect places like New York City, and in small towns, automation and globalization meant the industry that the town once relied on began to disappear.<br><br>
						
						
						In the 1980s and 1990s, a major shift occurred. In cities, urban renewal began to bring cities back to prominence. New York became clean again. Pollution laws enacted in the 70s began to make urban skies clearer. Business, trade, industry all began to build up the coastal areas, and in turn, immigration to large areas began to diversify the culture of the areas. Cities were shining again.<br><br>
						
						
						But a different story played out in rural America. Small towns refused to acknowledge that times were changing and that old jobs weren’t coming back, and as a result, businesses closed, and people moved away. Poverty began to become widespread, and a form of rural decay was present.<br><br>
						
						
						That decay never left. Ask someone who saw a big city in the 1970s and they’ll tell you that the city has really changed in a lot of ways. However, take one look at small towns, and often the places look the exact same, only boarded up, closed down, with paint peeling and fading.<br><br>
						
						
						Right next door to my hometown of Searcy is a little town called Kensett. 60 years ago, Kensett was a bustling town with a lot to do and a good economy for its size. Then, the railroad closed the local depot. Fast forward to today, and Kensett’s downtown is barren, empty. Many former stores have since burned down. I know my grandparents look around that town, the one they grew up in, and feel deep sorrow about what’s happened to it.<br><br>
						
						
						Kensett’s story is not unique. Many towns across the United States share similar stories. But let’s take a comparison between Kensett and Searcy. Searcy, while still a small town, adjusted as times changed. Searcy was never dependent on one business, and the town’s central area still has several small businesses left over from that era.<br><br>
						
						
						Searcy is an exception to the rule of tiny towns fading into the wilderness. In fact, the town is growing. Searcy has this attractiveness to it that it still has a small-town feeling, but it is undergoing urbanization, although it is on a small scale. The city has long had a reputation of having nothing to do, but more stores are starting to come here, and now that there is a private club-based liquor license application process, more restaurants are taking interest in moving here.<br><br>
						
						
						But, there is some resistance. Urbanization is a path towards diversification, and among those exists religion. Searcy is an extremely Christian town, there are over 100 churches here. But there also exists Harding University, a private Christian college that rules this town’s politics. They deeply oppose the liquor license system based on their grounds and worry that they will lose their reputation as a Christian university. The truth of the matter is that Harding is just as bad as, if not worse than, most schools. Plenty of normal college student things happen on campus that religion frowns upon, but Harding has the local newspaper in their back pocket, so the Daily Citizen never says a word.
