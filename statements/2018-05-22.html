			<p><b>Tuesday, May 22, 2018 - Get Its Act Together - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>The Democratic Party needs to get its act together. We could’ve passed common sense gun laws during the 2009-11 legislative session, but we didn’t. Because we didn’t, another group of kids had to senselessly die.</p>
			
			<p>I am an unabashed liberal and an outspoken socialist. The Democratic Party is not the party of the working people it once was. Because corporate donors fund weak neoliberal centrists, Democrats don’t know how to fight. Republicans waste no time in railroading through policies that benefit the wealthy and turn back social progress. Clinton and Obama were Republicans in Democratic clothing. They didn’t know how to fight for gun reform and therefore too many innocent children have had to die. We need to be just as stubborn and feisty as Republicans are. The American people overwhelmingly agree with us on the issues. If we could stop sucking off corporate America and fight for what we’re supposed to believe in, we’d win.</p>
