			<p><b>Tuesday, January 1, 2019 - George H. W. Bush - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>In this new year, it's time for retractions. The first retraction is about George H. W. Bush being a decent man after his death.</p>
			
			<p>George H. W. Bush was an unrepentant war criminal. He murdered 400 people when he bombed a known civilian shelter in Iraq in February 1991, a war crime. He ordered the mass slaughter of retreating Iraqi units, another war crime.</p>
			
			<p>He pardoned international criminals involved in the Iran-Contra affair, and orchestrated propaganda movements to conjure support for the Persian Gulf War.</p>
			
			<p>In the address he made where he had a bag of cocaine, he said it had been seized across the street from the White House. What actually happened is federal agents lured a local drug dealer there to buy it undercover.</p>
			
			<p>George Herbert Walker Bush was not an admirable man. He actively spent his life damaging the world. The problem was that his crimes were imperial in nature, so of course the corporate news media has to beautify his legacy.</p>
			
			<p>Speaking the truth about the crimes of public officials after their deaths is unheard of, because it is sacreligious to the true faith of this nation, American exceptionalism.</p>
