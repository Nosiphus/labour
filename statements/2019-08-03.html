						Prayers don’t work. There is no God.<br><br>
						
						
						Time and time again, these types of attacks have occurred, and no one ever wants to label the shooters as what they are, domestic terrorists. Anytime anyone in this country tries to deal with this situation, even on the slightest scale, gun nuts come raving about tyranny, as if a whole bunch of idiots with hunting equipment are going overthrow a nuclear-armed state with drone strike capabilities. And yet, these are the same people who call for endless military expansion, which if they truly worried about tyranny, would make their problems worse.<br><br>
						
						
						Europe does not have this problem. Switzerland, which does have high gun ownership rates, does not have this problem. Australia, which had this problem, put in legislation in the 1990s that fixed the problem.<br><br>
						
						
						Why must the United States government be beholden to a group of fascist sympathizing right-wing ideologues who are still mad about blacks not being in the fields anymore? It would take political courage for someone to say, “saving lives and protecting people is more important than securing another term in office”, but that’s what we need now more than anything else.
