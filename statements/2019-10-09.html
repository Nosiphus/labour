					<b>Wednesday, October 9, 2019 - Impeachment - Sean Crain and Zack Carter</b><br><br>
					
					In the wake of the impeachment inquiry, fellow Nosiphite <a href="https://www.nosiphus.com/nosiphites/zack-carter">Zack Carter</a>, in his capacity of reporter for Searcy High School's Lion TV, asked me a few questions as to what I thought of the matter. His article can be viewed <a href="https://searcylionpress.com/?p=49599">here</a>.

						<b>Zack:</b> How are you feeling about the impeachment inquiry?<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Sean:</b> While I believe that Donald Trump definitely deserves to be impeached and convicted, the Senate is controlled by his party. Unless the Republicans break ranks en masse, he will remain president until his term expires or he resigns. But part of this is about history: Trump will go down as one of the worst and most corrupt presidents in American history, alongside Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. If Congress doesn't do what it's supposed to do, its image will be tarnished in the history books forever.<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Zack:</b> Do you agree with what Pelosi and the other Democrats are doing?<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Sean:</b> Nancy Pelosi is terrible at her job and always has been. She's a centrist who still sticks to the failed triangulation strategy of the 1990s, not to mention she's a bought-off corporate hack. As progressives take down these bought-and-paid-for members of the Democratic Party, her standing will diminish. That being said, she knows good and well that impeachment is not going to remove Trump from the White House. An inquiry is a step in the right direction, but I doubt anything further will be successful unless a massive political bombshell the size of Watergate emerges.<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Zack:</b> Whose side are you on in this debate?<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Sean:</b> I take the view of Kyle Kulinski of Secular Talk: Obviously Donald Trump is a terrible president and is completely unfit for the office he holds, and has done multiple things to show he should not be in that office, but attempting to remove him will likely end up handing the Republican Party political capital in the next election. The reasoning for this is simple: When Bill Clinton beat impeachment, his approval ratings went up. Some of this was due to the fact that he was impeached over concocted Republican nonsense, if not most, but still, the reasoning remains.<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Zack:</b> Do you think Donald Trump has done anything that would bring up an impeachment in the past or the present?<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Sean:</b> No question. He has violated the Emoluments Clause several times over, he has failed to place his Trump Organization assets in a blind trust, and he has violated labor laws on several occasions. Attempting to get dirt on a political rival from a foreign power is clearly an impeachable offense.<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Zack:</b> Do you think people pushing for impeachment are in the wrong?<br><br>
						
						
						<b>Sean:</b> Yes and no. They are morally and legally right that he should be removed from his current position, but politically and electorally, it makes it easier for Trump to win a second term.<br><br>
						
						
						The problem is that a lot of these people are trying to protect Joe Biden from being damaged over obvious corruption issues. He's a weak candidate against Trump, but he isn't a threat to neoliberalism. Centrist Democrats are more concerned with preventing Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee and undoing the damage that the neoliberal economic order has done to the world since 1981, an economic system that has enriched the already wealthy and further impoverished the already poor.
