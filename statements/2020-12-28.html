					<b>Monday, December 28, 2020 - 2020 In Review - Sean Crain</b>
				
				</p>
				
				<div class="p">
				
					<p>
					
						Well, here we are once again, with less than a week remaining until an old year fades away and a new year begins. As is custom here, I will begin my year in review.<br><br>
						
						2020 has been a dumpster fire no matter how you look at it. The coronavirus pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, the economy is in the worst shape it has been in since the Great Depression, racial injustice is back at the forefront of debate, massive wildfires and unusually strong tropical hurricanes have made it clear that the climate crisis is continuing to worsen, people are at each other’s throats over the results of the election, and an outgoing president who refuses to accept his fate continues to fan the flames of outrage among his supporters.<br><br>
						
						There’s no honest way to talk about this year without including all of its misery and the destructiveness that has occurred during it. Make no doubt, 2020 is the single worst year of not just the last ten years, but also the most turbulent since 1968, over fifty years ago.<br><br>
						
						This year, I decided that the best way to encapsulate what happened throughout the past twelve months was through first-hand experiences.

						<b>RESPONSES</b><br><br>

						<p>
						
							<b>Jackson Benight</b><br><br>
							
							
							I met Jackson in the autumn of 2011. We've become really good friends over the last three years.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was going to my first international Disney Park.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							Well, I was looking into China because of my trip anyway, so very early.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							Quarantine was sweet. It brought all of my friends back into town and got me a few months off work. So, in ways it disrupted my normal life, in other wyas it restored a sense of normalcy that I'd been missing due to college.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							Only by bucket list trip to China. NBD.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							My youth pastor's wife was the first person I knew who caught it. She said it was like a bad flu. My youth pastor never showed symptoms at all.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I was disgusted by the murder, and my eyes were really opened to BLM for the first time. I always wrote them off as looters or SJWs in the past, but this year something was different.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							Badly, but I'm not sure what they could have done better, except open Disneyland because the actions at WDW were proven effective, but Dick Newsom needs to remove the stick from his anus.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							Those were this year? Feels like forever ago. I wasn't too concerned because they didn't directly affect me, ya know?<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							Good, it went how I was hoping it would. Maybe I would have liked to see a bigger margin of victory for Biden and Tom Cotton losing his seat, but overall I cannot be too disappointed.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I don't really know. It's not my biggest priority. I'm not opposed to it, but I think at-risk people should probably get them first.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope that Newsom removes the stick from his butt and reopens Disneyland. I also would like to see new movies come to theaters again.

							Nathan is one of the reporters for Lunatics. Before this month's restructuring, he was the chief product officer. He has been a member of Nosiphus since June 25, 2015.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was excited for what the year had in store for me and everyone else.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							It must've been late February.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							Honestly, they weren't too bad. I got schoolwork done and just stayed home. I thought it would be over sooner.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							Summer trips with friends, mostly. Couldn't name them but just stuff that would've happened.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							I actually had it, and so did my parents. I felt bad for three days with a fever and cough, then four days after that I lost smell and taste. After that I was fatigued for around two weeks. I quarantined for ten consecutive days. It felt like a bad flu but after that I was okay, just really tired.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I didn't really know. I was confused by how you can still see someone by the color of their skin. We are all human.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							Not very well. I am a Republican, but with how far the right and left has become, I don't think I can consider myself in any party. It was not handled well by the government and the media.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							I didn't know much about it because of where I was, but I did know it was bad and was getting worse.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							Rigged or not, I feel that the country needs to unite no matter the president. At the end of the day, it's going to be what you do for yourself.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I don't know if I'm immune since I had it, but even so, whoever needs it needs to get it. I may have beat it, but I don't have a problem with the vaccine like other people do.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I just hope it's better than this year.

							<b>Zack Carter</b><br><br>
							
							
							Zack is the editor-in-chief for Lunatics. He joined Nosiphus on July 4, 2017.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was looking forward to seeing my girlfriend Abby. I'm sad to say it hasn't happened yet, but 2021 is going to be the year.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							I don't remember the month, but when it was just a few cases in China. I started getting paranoid and everyone told me to chill out. Well, look what happened<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							It was very weird, but I loved it. I'm an inside person so I enjoyed it. After a while, however, it started to hit me how much I enjoyed going places. It didn't disrupt my life too much though. <br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							I did not get to visit Abby.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							Nobody that I know in-person got it. What I do know is that it was bad, and sometimes they still have side effects from it. <br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I hated it, and he didn't deserve to die at all. I was in support of the protests. Black Lives Matter.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							They handled it terribly in both, and it could've been done so much better. I'm disappointed that we have such an incompetent government.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							Very. There were a lot of animals that were killed, and I hated that. We need to worry more about the wildfires, as they really are disruptive to us and mother nature.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I didn't like the choices. We could've had Bernie or Yang, but I can't complain though and I settled for Biden. I'm excited to see that we're taking the right steps. All that said and done, I liked the outcome.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							Yes I am. If I do end up waiting, it'll only be a few weeks. Everyone should take the vaccine.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope to see my girlfriend. I hope to see this country back on track. I hope we handle Covid CORRECTLY. I hope for a lot of things.

							<b>Sydney Cook</b><br><br>
							
							
							Sydney has been a friend of mine since 2013. She has become increasingly concerned about climate change in the last few months, so political conversations between she and I have become quite regular.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was looking forward to visiting my sister in Buffalo, NY in the spring. We were going to stay in a beautiful AirBnB in Canada and see Niagra Falls. We were also going to stay a few nights in Fort Henry.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							Late February, early March I believe.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							It gave me a lot more of free time. It didn't have much of a negative effect on me.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							I couldn't go to my aunt's house for Thanksgiving.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							I had it, and several of my friends had it as well. It felt like a bad cold, and I couldn't taste anything for a while.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I thought his killing was unjust and ridiculous. I didn't think the idea of protesting was bad but I believe they got a little out of hand.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							Not good, lol.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							I found the wildfires very concerning.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I'm hopeful that we can come together and be stronger as a country.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I think I'll wait for a while.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope that I personally can figure out what I want to do in the future and get a plan ready to accomplish my goals. I hope that there is less conflict in 2021 and people learn to respect one another. I also hope the US government will start to take climate change more seriously.

							<b>Jason Faucett</b><br><br>
							
							
							Jason is the senior vice president over the engineering department. Before this month's restructure, he was our chief communications officer. He has been a member of Nosiphus since October 31, 2016.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I honestly thought that this year was going to be different. I thought that we would see many new and exciting things because it was "2020".<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							I first heard about coronavirus when I was just watching the news. That was back when it was still in the east, so I didn't think anything of it.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							I really didn't feel the direct effect of COVID, especially concerning quarantine. Most things that I was involved in didn't really take it seriously until a few months after.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							There were really no major events. I had to cancel minor things. The things that I would've normally attended were not even scheduled.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							No one that I know caught the coronavirus.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I don't know how to go about this honestly. I feel like it was a wake-up call for America. I don't necessarily agree with everything that happened with the event in and of itself, I do think that things can be fixed in this country on both sides.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							I think that the pandemic was handled almost as well as it could've been. I don't think that anyone in charge could've handled it perfectly. When you are in a position of power, you can never make everyone happy. As far as the protests go, I supported them as a right we have as American citizens. I also believe that the riots that everyone was adding in with them were completely separate.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							The wildfires were not as concerning to me because they weren't near me nor were they affecting me. I know that sounds self-centered but I just don't feel I have a valid take on that subject.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							So this is a big topic. I will say that I did not support the candidate that won the election. Besides that, I think that Biden won the election so he will be the next President of the United States. I think that Trump is being a sore loser about this whole thing. If anything comes up in the investigation, something and someone will be going down on either side. That being said, I personally don't like to believe that anything was rigged.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I think it will be a while before I can even get vaccinated, so I will probably get it when I can.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope that 2021 doesn't come too fast. I feel like everyone is trying to rush into next year, but I really hope that 2020's problems don't carry into 2021. As far as the whole year goes, I think that when everything has passed, everyone will look at things with a new light that they didn't have before.

							<b>Logan Hite</b><br><br>
							
							
							I met Logan in 2013. A conversation she had with me a few months ago became one of our press releases.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was originally going to get to continue to be me, and grow as much as I could as a person.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							It was early March. It was also the week before I got sent home from college.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							I don’t remember the beginning being very hard. I simply finished my classes and hung out with friends a lot.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							There were several concerts, as well a formal event for college that I was very excited about.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							I’ve known no one close to me that got it.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I was very upset by the event of his death and truly believed he had been done wrong by the police, however, personally I did not agree with the protests. Vandalizing property is not the answer because it’s stooping to the level of the people that caused the problem in the first place. It just really unsettled me.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							All I can say for this is LOL.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							I honestly didn’t hear much about either. I was very worried for the wildlife in both areas and the major loss of trees<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I still feel like an outcome hasn’t been determined. Every week there is something new coming out about it. It’s a very frustrating situation.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I will be waiting for a while.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							The same as 2020... to be the best version of myself that I can be.

							<b>Seth Holeyfield</b><br><br>
							
							
							I have known Seth about as long as I've known Nate. Seth is the complete political opposite of me, and I don't agree with much he says, but I do believe it is important to acknowledge opposing viewpoints.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was looking forward to a new decade that should be full of new experiences, memories, and the beginning of the rest of my life. I was looking forward to voting, Razorback sports, and my internship that was to take place over the summer.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							I first heard about the coronavirus in late January, early February when there were whispers of it over the Internet and media.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							The first few months were rough. I did not have very good contact with friends, my teachers were not prepared for how we were to end the semester, and I felt disjointed and separated from the rest of the world. It made me a bit depressed, to be honest.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							I personally did not have anything cancelled, but my family had to cancel trips they were going on. They were pretty sad about it.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							I nor no one I knew personally caught the virus, but there were a few potential scares.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							My reaction was that, while the officer was in the wrong, everyone was blowing it out of proportion. I know you may not agree with me, but people should not hold up one man's death, a criminal's death, as a symbol for a political/racial/social movement. While there is still racial injustice in the world, we cannot rid ourselves of it completely, nor should we hold an entire group of people responsible for the death of a man when it was one individual's mistake. The riots, not protests, were stupid. I understand you want to get your point across, but violence and criminal activity is not the way to do it. I know some were protesting peacefully, but the media tended to only cover the portion that grabs attention. I think that the George Floyd thing blew up for no good reason, and that if it weren't for BLM looking for a crutch to get the government to bottlefeed them, it would've been talked about for about a week at most, then forgotten.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							The government did what they could. I understand that some people wanted to stay locked up for safety, but the majority of Americans can't survive like that. Economically, we just couldn't survive like that. I think that the government could've done better, but I understand that their attention was on more important matters, the pandemic. Honestly, in Portland and Seattle I would've sent in the National Guard as soon as the riots started to help prevent damages and losses. Many innocent people lost their livelihoods just because a bunch of selfish "protestors" wanted to get their point across.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							California is on fire every year. It didn't bother me too much, but I was worried for people's safety. It is going to keep happening until they actually thin the forests and do proper conservation to prevent them. In Australia, I was a bit more worried because it is less frequent and the number of endangered species there is significantly larger.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I do not agree with the outcome of the election. I think there is obvious fraud and corruption going on, especially within the Democratic Party, but this is nothing new to me. Biden may be inaugurated in January, but I won't be happy about it. I won't protest it, however, like the Democrats did when Trump won fair and square. I also won't be surprised when Kamala Harris is sworn in because Joe Biden either died or was deemed unfit to be president. I think there should be more investigation on the election personally. We spent three years looking into fake Russia stuff, surely we can spend another year looking into the fudging of laws and regulations going on into the political parties and the polls.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							Yes, I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I can. I am at risk due to my various health issues, one of them being asthma.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							My hopes for 2021 is that we get back to a somewhat "normal" life, that the new heads of our country don't run it into the ground, and that I can enjoy getting together in large groups with friends and family again. Also, I want in person classes back, I hate online class. I can't learn well this way.

							Like Nate and Seth, I have known Julia for ten years. We've talked a lot over the last two, and while I still consider myself the more left-wing of the two of us, she's not far from me.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							I was looking forward to my senior year, going to college, and spending time with friends.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							March. I remember debating about how serious it was before it officially became a pandemic.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							I didn't mind spending time by myself. It did kind of ruin the end of my senior year though.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							😐<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							Fortunately, everyone I know that's gotten it had minor symptoms and recovered quickly.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							Anger and sadness. I started trying to educate myself more, as well as educate other people.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							😐 I return to the emoji.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							Concerning, but by that point I could only kinda handle so many catastrophes at once.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I cried tears of joy.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I'm planning on getting vaccinated as soon as it's available to me, if only so that I can go safely back to campus in the fall.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I've learned not to really get my hopes up at this point.

							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							I missed graduation and prom.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							One of my friends has COVID-19 right now. "I hate it" is what he says.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I was pretty mad at the police officers and the people who sat there recording it but didn't do anything. The protests were okay but I didn't like the raids.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							The government didn't handle the pandemic at all for a while, and they responded to the protests by attacking the peaceful ones, which is pretty bad.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							I have friends in Australia, so that was pretty concerning. The ones in California were bad too, but they're common out there.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I didn't care who won. I just thought people would stop fighting after the election. I'm very disappointed that no one did.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							A lot of people are concerned about the vaccine being tested or possible side effects, so I'll probably wait. I rarely go out anyway, so I should be fine either way.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope it's better.

							<b>Nate Sawyers</b><br><br>
							
							
							I have known Nate longer than anyone else I've asked these questions to. He and I have been friends since 2009. He has never joined Nosiphus but has basically been treated as if he were a member.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							#GetJakeAGirlfriend2020.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							I think I heard about passing in February, but I think the big news then was concerned with the wildfires in Australia.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							They were interesting and stressful, a mix of boredom and relaxation. School was very stressful, but I had more time to reflect and relax, so I enjoyed a part of it. It greatly disrupted my regular life, but it solidified a radical idea in me that society doesn't have to be the way that it was before.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							Not really, but all my events were altered.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							No.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							I was disturbed by the video, but not entirely shocked. It's not the first unjust execution, I initially supported the protests, but I didn't support the following violence.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							They did okay. People spread the pandemic and disregarded many regulations. In my opinion, the government should have been more creative on the state and federal level, and heeded to the WHO guidance instead of instituting ineffective knee-jerk reactions. The vast majority of government regulations were merely virtue signaling. The protests were mainly overlooked by politicians. The protests were tolerated. Instead of listening to what the movement had to say, the politicians saw the BLM movement as a platform to gain popularity. They either vocally "supported" the cause or they vocally denounced it on the basic of the protests' violence. Politicians who supported BLM did not carry that support into legislation. The actual governing bodies at the state and local level did well enough, allowing for exceptions to COVID regulations in order for protests to occur.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							They weren't concerning. I can only worry about so much at once without going crazy.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							I was happy that SNL would have to come up with a new kind of joke. Now that I am an adult, I'm interested in seeing what a Democrat might be able to do in office.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I'm waiting. Others need it more than I do, and I am distrustful of the pharmaceutical industry.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							I hope to enjoy time and learn.

							<b>Tremere Shell</b><br><br>
							
							
							I have known Tremere since 2013. He has contributed to a few articles.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When the year first started, what were you originally looking forward to in the brand new 2020?</b><br>
							
							A fresh start to a brand new decade.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When did you first hear about the coronavirus?</b><br>
							
							Around the end of January; there were mostly memes that downsized the threat it would become.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How were those first few months of quarantine? How disruptive was it to you as a person?</b><br>
							
							It didn't bother me as much. I had fun from watching shows and thinking while being stuck in my dorm.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Were there any major events you had to cancel because of the pandemic?</b><br>
							
							I had a play for theater that was cancelled, as well as a few events for school, but not much.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Did you or someone you know catch the coronavirus? If they recovered, how did they describe the disease?</b><br>
							
							Yes, I knew someone. It was described as the most miserable time of their life.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>When George Floyd was killed, what was your reaction, and how did you feel about the following protests?</b><br>
							
							It's nothing new. The black community is often oppressed while half of the country chooses not to listen to the outbursts. Plenty of peaceful protests had taken place but only the riots were covered and given a false narrative.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How do you think the government handled the pandemic and the protests?</b><br>
							
							Very poorly. The country displayed the same showing as a toddler throwing a fit in a store while other children (or countries) stand and watch.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How concerning were the Australia and California wildfires?</b><br>
							
							Pretty concerning but less as other problems rose.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>How did you feel about the outcome of the election?</b><br>
							
							It happened. No matter who won, no one can change it.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Are you planning on getting vaccinated as soon as possible, or are you planning on waiting for a while?</b><br>
							
							I feel I'll wait to see how the first wave of people goes.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>Lastly, what are your hopes for 2021?</b><br>
							
							Hopefully people keep a good mentality and mindset. This year has revealed the worst, so there is only one way to go: forward.
