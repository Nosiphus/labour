			<p><b>Wednesday, November 27, 2019 - FTC, COPPA, and YouTube - Sean Crain and an anonymous friend</b></p>
			
			<p>I received a message over Instagram about my thoughts on the FTC COPPA situation from a friend who wishes to remain anonymous, but agreed to allow me to post the transcript. Here's the conversation, slightly edited to correct for spelling and grammatical errors.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: You don't know or don't remember me from high school but I'm curious to ask you your viewpoint on this whole YouTube vs FTC and COPPA situation.</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Yeah, I remember who you are. My current viewpoint is that the FTC has given us some clarity on what constitutes "made for kids," but we need more. YouTube failed to tell us all the details and now everyone's in panic mode.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: What is your take on the vague standards of what is deemed "made for kids?"</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Well, for starters, the law was written in 1998, and in a lot of ways, the things it directly addressed were more clear at the time. You didn't have many adults playing on the Nintendo 64 or PlayStation, so gaming was never really considered. {late addition: Video streaming services were essentially nonexistent in 1998, so they couldn't plan for that either} Twenty years on, and adults make up a larger proportion of gamers than do children. The FTC needs to completely redo their ruling, and Congress needs to update the law.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: Exactly, because I've noticed you have a YouTube channel, on which you have some <em>Minecraft</em> or "kids' games" content under FTC standards.</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: I went through and labeled everything as I viewed it, and provided a rationale as to why I labeled it that way in each description. <em>Minecraft</em> is so huge that the FTC is really going to have evaluate content as to whether each video is "made for kids." They specifically mentioned this as true for animation, and as gaming's not clearly defined in the law, that's what we're working from.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: Wasn't it stated in YouTube's video on topic that YouTube will be using a bot of some sorts to enforce these things?</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Yes. There's an algorithm that is going to try and catch stuff, but it's going to get false positives.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: Lastly, the whole blame game. Why should I, a creator, be responsible for someone's child getting on a website that is set up for ages 13 and up, and then the parent not responsibly enforcing rules for your child when it comes to the Internet?</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: That's the thing. YouTube is COPPA-compliant in that under-13s can't comment {or use other YouTube features} because they can't log in{, and the FTC doesn't hold groups accountable when a child lies about their age}. The problem is that YouTube's advertising system collected data {for personalized ads} regardless of whether you were logged in or not.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: But this is all falling onto the creators themselves, is it not?</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Yes. YouTube knew that the best option for everyone, only running personalized ads on videos when logged in, would cost them a lot of money, so they decided to push it onto creators instead.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: So, I guess we can just hope for the best?</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Yes.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: Well, thank you for talking to me about your stance on this topic.</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: You're welcome. Would you mind me posting the transcript of this conversation to the statements section of the Nosiphus site?</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: Does my name have to be stated?</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: I can anonymize your name.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: That will be fine.</p>
			
			<p><b>Sean</b>: Thanks.</p>
			
			<p><b>Anonymous</b>: No problem.</p>
