					<b>Friday, June 26, 2020 - American Exceptionalism Needs To Die - Sean Crain</b>

					<p>
					
						Right now, the pandemic and the national protests have exposed deep-seated flaws in this nation's fabric, among them being the ineffectiveness of the healthcare system, the deeply racist past we have refused to acknowledge as a country, and worst of all, the simple fact that Americans don't care about what happens to other Americans. This nation founded itself on individualism and an approach to society that said, "Fuck you, only I matter."<br><br>
						
						
						If anything good is to come out of this pandemic, hopefully it will be the complete evisceration of American exceptionalism. The US is not instrinscially better than any other country in the world, and in many ways, it's worse.<br><br>
						
						
						The rest of the world got on top of this pandemic as quickly as possible, and it is declining or even over in most countries. These nations have a concept of society that says if one of us gets sick, that's bad for all of us, and their healthcare systems were far better equipped to handle the response. There was no major political backlash to safety precautions in Europe.<br><br>
						
						
						Meanwhile, in the US, instead of preparing for the crisis when we had time, we pretended like it wasn't an issue, pointed the finger at China in some stupid geopolitical game, and we said that we should get it over with and let the vulnerable die. Then when it became clear that the virus was going to be a problem, we acted like it would be small and over soon, and an entire political party decided that even the most basic safety measure of mask-wearing was a sign that you hated the president.<br><br>
						
						
						This country likes to pride itself on being the big bully that forces everyone in the world to do things the way it wants them done, and for forty years we have been in decline. We are the imperalist bully that invades small defenseless countries to plunder their resources, the hypocrite that attacks censorship of whistleblowers while it does the same, and the militarist that dreams of total dominance of the global economy.<br><br>
						
						
						All empires eventually fall, and like the British before us, it is increasingly looking like the days of US hegemony are coming to an end as a deeply divided nation rips itself apart. The US flag stands for corporate oligarchy, war, racism, and xenophobia. Any remaining good things it stood for were wiped out in the 1980s when we forgot the lessons of the Great Depression and World War II. The rest of the world is laughing at us, and rightfully so.<br><br>
						
						
						It's not like I wish any of that were true, nor do I wish that this country dissolve itself out of existence, but the truth of the matter is that we have to acknowledge that this country has been in terrible shape for decades. We have to let go of the idea that our country is better than anyone else's because it's not. The only we're number one in anymore are defense spending, number of incarcerated citizens per capita, and, sadly, coronavirus cases and deaths.<br><br>
						
						
						We have it within us to change, but we haven't because we don't really want to. Hopefully, this crisis will force us to do it, and we'll come out of it a far better country if we acknowledge that.
