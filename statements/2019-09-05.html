					<b>Thursday, September 5, 2019 - Brexit Chaos - Sean Crain</b>
				
				</p>
				
				<div class="p">
				
					<p>
					
						Boris Johnson has had only five days in office when he could do anything in Parliament, the two days before the August recess, and the last three days. He was defeated on his first vote as prime minister, and he lost control of the parliamentary schedule.<br><br>
						
						
						He has prorogued Parliament to prevent it from performing its normal functions, and he is attempting to sidestep the legislature. He wants to force through a no-deal Brexit. He has expelled thirty members of his own party, among them the longest serving MP currently in the Commons, former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, another former Chancellor, Philip Hammond, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill. This move is unprecedented.<br><br>
						
						
						The opposition parties, plus the now independent Tory rebels, have a comfortable majority over the government. Jeremy Corbyn should do all he can to ensure no-deal is prevented, and that a general election is facilitated as soon as possible. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the SNP must work together tactically, in order to ensure that the Conservative Party is removed from office in October. Britain needs a government that can actually do its job. Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party are completely incapable of this. His recent actions have shown that he cares more about maintaining his position as prime minister than he cares about running the country, and he will do all it takes to further his own career.<br><br>
						
						
						This rotten government must finally come to an end. Britain has suffered for nearly a decade. This Brexit chaos is entirely the fault of the Conservative Party. David Cameron proposed the referendum and failed to win it. Theresa May failed to negotiate a proper deal. Boris has no chance of changing that.<br><br>
						
						
						Only Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party can fix this.
