			<p><b>Sunday, August 4, 2019 - Is there no end? - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>Is there no end to this madness? Less than twenty-four hours after the El Paso tragedy, another gunman took at least nine more people to the grave in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
			
			<p>This is the only industrialized nation where this kind of blatant violence occurs. But it’s not just guns. We live in a perverse culture that worships war and militarism, and due to economic factors and problems in the healthcare system, despair has been on the rise.</p>
			
			<p>The suicide rate is up. The mass shootings are commonplace. We need to deal with this problem.</p>
			
			<p>Gun control works. European nations have it. Australia had a massacre in 1996, and mass shootings virtually disappeared after they passed strict laws about it.</p>
			
			<p>Tyrannical government is not going to be prevented by guns. If that’s the reason you want to keep them, I have news for you: you’ve already lost. The US government is a nuclear-armed state with drone strike capabilities. If theoretical tyranny’s what you’re protesting, you should not support endless expansion of the military and illegal regime change wars.</p>
			
			<p>We need to address the root causes of this.</p>
			
			<p>This is caused by an amalgamation of hatred and despair. People have been so poor for so long in this country that it’s become easy for demagogic political figures to prey on their instinctual tribalist fears and turn them against immigrants, a group with no money and no power. The gun epidemic is happening, quite frankly, because we haven’t dealt with mental health issues and rising poverty leading to more and more despair.</p>
			
			<p>We have to deal with these problems, all of them, in order to correct this. We have the capability to do so. We’ve lost far too many over the course of the last 20 years.</p>
