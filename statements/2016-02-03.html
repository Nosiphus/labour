			<p><b>Wednesday, February 3, 2016 - Nationalism - Sean Crain</b></p>
			
			<p>I would like to point out a problem this nation has. It's people don't realize it. But let me begin. The United States doesn't have patriotism. It has nationalism. We live in a country that since birth, children are subject to the Pledge and to the National Anthem. We over glorify our military, and we have an extensive empire. No other nation in the world has levels of patriotism this high. </p>
