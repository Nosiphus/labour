					<b>Thursday, July 2, 2020 - The N-Word - Sean Crain</b>

						I know quite a few people who wonder what the big deal is revolving around casual usage of the n-word by white people. I have never really had a proper answer to it, so I've just sat back and started to think about it, and I remembered past things I have read about the topic as I did.<br><br>
						
						
						Just recently I was asked why a common epithet for white people generally doesn't offend us when it's used. I've had that in the back of my mind for a couple days, and in the last hour or so (statement was written at about 4:00 AM), I've been really focused on it. This is what I've processed.<br><br>
						
						
						When someone uses the word "cracker", just as an example, why are most whites generally not offended? If it were just about pejorative insults, then it should be just as offensive as the n-word. However, the reason it doesn't hit us as hard is the fact that few of us actually know what it means, and because of that, it carries little weight.<br><br>
						
						
						The origin of the word is not as clearly defined as the n-word's is. In the Elizabethan era, Middle English versions of the word were used to describe braggarts and those who liked to tell jokes. About 200 years later, the word referred to former white convicts in the pre-independence British America. By the 1850s, the word referred to slaveowners who whipped slaves.<br><br>
						
						
						I was unaware of the meaning of the term because I had no reason to look it up. That word isn't part of our venacular, and because of that, it carries little weight with us. I'm sure many white people don't actually know what the word means, because I know I certainly didn't.<br><br>
						
						
						But the history of the n-word <em>is</em> clearly defined, and carries a lot of baggage. The word itself is a purposeful mispronounciation of "negro," which was the proper term used for blacks during the days of slavery and Jim Crow. I don't know if the black community considers the word "negro" to be overtly offensive or just outdated, as it was a proper term and is also the word for the color black in Spanish, but it certainly could be viewed that way.<br><br>
						
						
						But the slur status of its mispronounced counterpart is unquestionable. That word was used explicity by whites to describes blacks as less than human, and they used it that way for centuries. The word was said to mean "a dirty, uncivilized, uncontrollable animal", and given the stereotypical view of Africans as being primal brutes, it's clear that it was not a friendly or welcoming term.<br><br>
						
						
						The actions associated with that word carry a weight that a word like cracker doesn't. White people weren't forcefully abducted from their home continent during a 400 year commercial operation and called crackers. They weren't forced into involuntary servitude and called crackers. They weren't treated as second class citizens with no financial standing and called crackers. They weren't hunted down and terrorized by members of supremacist organizations and called crackers. They didn't have the state turn the hoses on them just because they were protesting for basic equality before the law and called crackers. They weren't labeled superpredators by a state looking to throw as many people in prison as possible for private profits and called crackers. They aren't being indiscriminately killed by law enforcement and called crackers.<br><br>
						
						
						Context is huge. There is a reason why certain slurs are more offensive than others. Some don't have defined meanings or have very loosely defined ones. The n-word is the single most defined racial epithet that exists.<br><br>
						
						
						There is an argument to be made over the social acceptability of the n-word within the black community, and there is a debate over it. I am not a member of that community, and the internal social mobility of what is a slur when used externally is a matter for them, but what should be fundamentally clear is that non-blacks, especially including whites, should not use that word.<br><br>
