			<p><b>Political Positions</b><br>Most of these apply to the United States, but a few are about the United Kingdom.</p>
			
			<p><b>Abortion</b><br>I am fully pro-choice. I believe that we can reduce the number of abortions by providing proper sex education and by making contraceptives easier to access. I also believe we need to remove the social stigmas around sex that stem from this country's Puritan background.</p>
			
			<p><b>Affirmative Action</b><br>I support affirmative action programs for women and minorities. It's an understatement to say that rich white guys haven't done these people a lot of justice throughout history, and giving them preferential treatment for a while is the least we can do to try and mend these things.</p>
			
			<p><b>Antitrust</b><br>This nation has systematically failed to enforce its antitrust laws in the last fifty years, and it shows: fifty major media companies became five. AT&T, once the country's historic monopoly, has already reacquired many of its former Baby Bells, undoing what the Justice Department did in 1984. We, as a nation, must start enforcing the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 again, and ensure that mega-monopolies like Amazon aren't allowed to completely crush their competitors.</p>
			
			<p><b>Banks</b><br>After wrecking the global economy in the 2000s, the biggest banks asked for taxpayer bailouts, and they got them. The common man asked for some help as well, and he got shafted. These big banks should be broken up, and every single one of the major executives who caused the collapse of the global economy should be prosecuted and placed in federal prison. We should also restore the Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933, and we should implement basic, government-operated banking services at the post offices of this nation.</p>
			
			<p><b>Borders</b><br>The United States does not need a wall on its southern border. If anything, we should welcome these immigrants who choose this country to find a better life for themselves and their families. The US should also stop overthrowing the governments of Latin American nations, as this would stop a large percentage of the current influx.</p>
			
			<p><b>Brexit</b><br>The United Kingdom must understand that it is no longer the great global superpower that it once was, and I don't think it's ever come to terms with that. The bottom line is that it, alongside the other European nations, have become essentially powerless on their own. If the UK is truly looking out for its future, it would understand that it must remain a member of the European Union. The EU makes all European nations powerful, and it beefs up their global negotiating power. The UK is only going to shoot itself in the foot by leaving.</p>
			
			<p><b>Capital Gains</b><br>The capital gains tax is unnecessary and allows the wealthy to avoid normal taxation rates by reclassifying their earnings. This separate tax should be eliminated and capital gains should be taxed at normal income rates.</p>
			
			<p><b>Civil Rights</b><br>I support amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the already codified protections. I also believe these should be extended to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which should be fully restored.</p>
			
			<p><b>Climate Change</b><br>We have delayed dealing with this issue for far too long. I support Sen. Bernie Sanders' version of the Green New Deal. I'm also in favor of a system that would convert all existing petroleum cars to electric vehicles via a government-sponsored trade-in system, or a conversion system for classic cars. I want to see all petroleum vehicles off the road within the next ten years. We should utilize the massive amount of space in the deserts of the big western states to build massive solar installations and power the nation. We should also look into giving each house its own independent electrical system.</p>
			
			<p><b>College</b><br>College has essentially become a necessity in order to make a decent living nowadays. I support free public college and university, and I support cancelling student debt. I believe giving those who paid it off a rebate would be a good idea. I also think that much of what is taught in college should be introduced to the high school environment.</p>
			
			<p><b>Corporate Taxes</b><br>Corporations should have a taxation system that has incentives and penalties for certain behaviors. The penalties should be significant enough to damage the bottom line of the company, and not a slap on the wrist. I would also support a progressive taxation system for corporations with a different set of brackets.</p>
			
			<p><b>Criminal Punishment</b><br>The tough-on-crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s failed. What we should do is look at the Nordic model of rehabilitation instead of punishment, and we should adopt that system. It has a lower recitivism rate, and former convicts tend to be more productive once they're out.</p>
			
			<p><b>Death Penalty</b><br>This barbaric practice has no place in the legal code of a modern, secular, democratic nation. There should not be a state-sanctioned right to kill someone, regardless of what the individual has done.</p>
			
			<p><b>Defense</b><br>We cannot continue to be the policeman of the world. We also cannot continue to fight these long, drawn-out, illegal regime change wars in the Middle East. We spend way too much on the military as a result of Ronald Reagan's mission to kill the already collapsing Soviet Union faster. We should institute a cut in military spending of at least 50%. We should also adopt non-interventionism as official government policy. Defense contracts should be ended, and we must curtail the power of the military-industrial complex.</p>
			
			<p><b>Education</b><br>The education system in this nation is absolutely ridiculous. Our students are not engaged with learning, and what I've found is that most of the time, school is generally just blow-off time, especially high school. For one, standardized testing is not helpful, and it should be brought to an end. In addition to ensuring teachers are paid more, we should also look into completely redoing the school day and workflow. The factory-inspired system of having a bell ring notifying you that you need to get to the next workstation, or in this case, class, is outdated.</p>
			
			<p><b>Energy</b><br>Capitalism provides absolutely no incentive to get private companies to move away from fossil fuels. I support nationalization of the energy sector, as I feel it's the only way we can fully take power away from fossil fuel executives.</p>
			
			<p><b>Federation</b><br>I support the continued structure of the nation, but I also believe there needs to be a significant amount of improvement in regards to cohesion between different branches and levels of the government.</p>
			
			<p><b>Free Trade</b><br>I support fair trade. Free trade between two nations that have similar levels of economic development is beneficial to everyone, but free trade between two nations on different development levels is not. I support a selective tariff model that would apply different tariff rates depending on how the worker safety regulations, environmental standards, and wages of the country in question compare to that of the United States. This would hopefully encourage China to improve its standards, and encourage the US to catch up to Europe, as this tariff would effectively subsidize European imports.</p>
			
			<p><b>Gun Control</b><br>No person in this nation needs to be in possession of any type of firearm that doesn't have a significant reload delay. The Founding Fathers had access to muskets, not semi-automatic assault weapons.</p>
			
			<p><b>Healthcare</b><br>It is time for Medicare for All. It's time to cancel medical debt. The United States is the only industrialized nation on the planet that doesn't have a national healthcare program, and the time to join them is long overdue.</p>
			
			<p><b>Income Taxes</b><br>Taxes on the wealthy have fallen significantly in the past fifty years, and the deficit has risen because of it. The tax rates of the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, indexed to and adjusted for inflation, should be part of the next administration's budget.</p>
			
			<p><b>Inheritance Taxes</b><br>A lack of a proper estate tax has led to oligarchy by allowing great-grandchildren who haven't worked a day in their lives to hold on to the fortunes their great-grandfathers acquired. I believe that there should be a progressive inheritance tax that caps at 100% on every dollar past five million.</p>
			
			<p><b>Military Intervention</b><br>The US needs to get out of its illegal wars in the Middle East, adopt non-interventionism, and then prosecute George W. Bush and Dick Cheney for war crimes.</p>
			
			<p><b>Monetary System</b><br>A contributing factor to the stability of the mid-century economic system was the existence of the Bretton Woods agreements. It's not a crazy idea to consider returning to the fixed exchange rates to get rid of currency speculation.</p>
			
			<p><b>Net Neutrality</b><br>All traffic on the internet should be treated equally. End of discussion. This should be codified into law.</p>
			
			<p><b>Social Security</b><br>The Social Security system can remain solvent if we lift the taxable earnings cap and by redirecting some unneeded military funds into the program.</p>
			
			<p><b>Tax Loopholes</b><br>Tax loopholes should be closed and the British government should be held accountable on the world stage for being at the epicenter of the global tax avoidance industry.</p>
			
			<p><b>Trade Unions</b><br>It was the trade union movement that built the middle class. Strong unions are absolutely essential to ensuring that the wealthy can't just railroad through anything they want without considering how it will affect the people who actually do all the work.</p>
			
			<p><b>Women's Equality</b><br>The Equal Pay Act of 1963 should be properly enforced so that women are paid the same as men for the same jobs.</p>
			
			<p><b>Worker Co-operatives</b><br>Worker co-ops should be encouraged as a natural replacement to the capitalist business model. It's democratic, fairer, and generally more productive.</p>
