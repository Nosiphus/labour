					<b>Political Positions</b><br>
					
					These are United States political positions.<br>
					
					These are the views of Sean Crain.

					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Abortion</b><br><br>
							
							
							I believe that a woman's right to choose constitutes a fundamental exercise of the right to privacy, and the decision taken should be made by the woman and her physician. The government should fund Planned Parenthood as well as provide abortion services as a component of a national Medicare-for-all program. To reduce the amount of abortions, comprehensive sex education should be conducted in schools, and we should work to alleviate the social stigma surrounding sex that originated from the Puritan background of the Pilgrims four hundred years ago.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Affirmative Action</b><br><br>
							
							
							Rich, white men have been in charge of the world since the beginning of human civilization, and along the way that group of people did some horrific things to other human beings. The detriment that slavery did to the African American population of this country did not end on June 19, 1865. Reparations for centuries of injustice are morally required if the poverty that too many black citizens still find themselves mired in is ever going to be dealt with.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Antitrust</b><br><br>
							
							
							Companies that are left to their own devices will inevitably begin to consolidate and monopolize the markets they operate in. Standard Oil was the first mega-corporate monopoly, and its power was left unchecked for many years. The America of the Gilded Age understood that monopolies had to be reined in and regulated out of existence, which is why the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was passed. 130 years later, and America has forgotten about monopolies. The government has systematically failed to enforce its antitrust regulations, and the fact that fifty major media companies have become five is the largest example of this. AT&T, America's historic monopoly, has already re-acquired most of its former Baby Bells after the 1984 breakup. We must rein in these corporations and start enforcing the Sherman Act again.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Banks</b><br><br>
							
							
							After destroying the economy in the late noughties, banks asked for taxpayer bailouts, and the government gave them whatever they wanted with almost no strings attached. The common man also needed a bailout, but he got shafted. The banks that failed in 2008 are bigger today than they were during their "too big to fail" heyday. Every single one of these large financial institutions should be broken up, have their assets bought up and nationalized, and their executives prosecuted for their roles in the financial crisis. We should also restore the Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933, which would've prevented the behavior that caused the bank failures in the first place, and we should also revitalize the post offices of this nation by implementing basic banking services at every one in this country.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Borders</b><br><br>
							
							
							The United States founded itself on the principle that it was a nation of immigrants. If it's going to stay true to that principle, it cannot enforce the current hostile policy towards immigration that it has at the present time. There is no need for a border wall, or even a border fence. If anything, we should be welcoming people who come to this country in search of a better life. If the United States truly wants to reduce the number of immigrants from Latin America, the first thing it should do is stop its policy of overthrowing Latin American governments for US corporate interests.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Capital Gains</b><br><br>
							
							
							There is absolutely no reason as to why capital gains should be taxed differently from normal income. The capital gains tax should be abolished and the income generated should be taxed at regular income rates.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Civil Rights</b><br><br>
							
							
							The Civil Rights Act of 1964 needs to be amended to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the existing codified protections of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 needs to be fully restored as well.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Climate Change</b><br><br>
							
							
							No other issue will matter if we as a species do not get this under control. The Green New Deal is the largest, most ambitious program we have to combat climate change, and we only have ten years to stop it before it is irreversible. I believe that a program should be in force that would allow car owners to convert their vehicles from petroleum-based to electricity-based propulsion. This should exist in the form of a national trade-in program and a special conversion for classic vehicles. Petroleum engines should be completely banned from the road in ten years. We should also utilize the massive amounts of space in the deserts of the big western states to build massive solar panel installations to power the nation. We should also build houses to have their own electrical grid.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>College</b><br><br>
							
							
							Having any shot at a middle-class living these days requires a college education. I support free public college and university, and I support the cancellation of all student debt. Those who paid it off should be given a rebate as well. Much of what is taught in the college environment should also be brought to the high school environment. In addition to this, we cannot allow the wealthy to continue to insulate themselves from the working class by sending their kids to prestigious private universities, so we should begin the process of eliminating private education in all its elitist forms.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Corporate Taxation</b><br><br>
							
							
							The British government could put a stop to the global tax avoidance industry tomorrow if it forced its overseas dependencies to enforce British tax laws, but instead, it allows multinational corporations to dodge taxes which cost the nations of the world hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue that could be used for public services. Heavy penalties should be imposed against tax dodgers and the United Kingdom should be condemned on the world stage for allowing this to happen.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Criminal Justice</b><br><br>
							
							
							The tough-on-crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s were thinly-veiled programs to go after minorities and poor kids for minor drug offenses at the behest of the private prison industry. It has produced a high recitivism rate and it does not deal with the fundamental causes of crime. To truly be tough on crime, we have to be tough on poverty. Drug offenses shouldn't even be crimes, because human beings should have full autonomy on what they can and cannot put into their bodies, and the Controlled Substances Act should be repealed. The Nordic model of rehabilitation is a far more successful criminal justice model, as it has lower recitivism rates and results in significantly more productive ex-convicts upon release.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Death Penalty</b><br><br>
							
							
							This barbaric practice has absolutely no place in the criminal justice systems or legal frameworks of any modern, secular, democratic nation. The right to kill a human being should never be granted to any government for any reason, and the fact that some who have been put to death were later determined to have been innocent is one of the single biggest reasons of why this practice is wrong.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Defense</b><br><br>
							
							
							The United States cannot continue to be the world's policeman. We have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of any self-determining, fully independent nation, and our illegal regime change wars in the Middle East must be brought to a halt. Our military spending is bloated out of control and needs to be cut in half at the least. The official policy of the American government should be non-interventionism, and we should end existing defense contracts in order to curtail the power of the military-industrial complex.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Education</b><br><br>
							
							
							Our education system is one of the worst in the industrialized world. Our students are not engaged with learning, and from my own experience, I can tell you that I went to school for a half a day during my senior year, and I spent a significant portion of my time during the day goofing off, and I was an A student. Our education model is still based on the factory worker model of going to the next station when the bell rings. We need to completely overhaul our approach to education, starting with the elimination of standardized testing. These tests do nothing but complicate teachers' lesson plans and give the students who do cram their days full of AP classes even more stress. We should place limits on the amount of advanced courses students are allowed to take, and we should also look into the college model of allowing students significantly more freedom of movement.

						<p>
						
							<b>Energy</b><br><br>
							
							
							Capitalism provides absolutely no incentive for private companies to move away from fossil fuels. The only way for us to combat this problem effectively is to nationalize the energy sector. With oil currently trading in the negatives, this would be a perfect time to bring the petroleum industry down once and for all.
