					<b>Political Positions</b><br>
					
					These are United States political positions.<br>
					
					These are the views of Sean Crain.

						<p>
						
							<b>Abortion</b><br><br>
							
							
							I believe that a woman's right to choose constitutes a fundamental exercise of the right to privacy, and the decision taken should be made by the woman and her physician. The government should fund Planned Parenthood as well as provide abortion services as a component of a national Medicare-for-all program. To reduce the amount of abortions, comprehensive sex education should be conducted in schools, and we should work to alleviate the social stigma surrounding sex that originated from the Puritan background of the Pilgrims four hundred years ago.
						
						</p>

						<p>
						
							<b>Affirmative Action</b><br><br>
							
							
							Rich, white men have been in charge of the world since the beginning of human civilization, and along the way that group of people did some horrific things to other human beings. The detriment that slavery did to the African American population of this country did not end on June 19, 1865. Reparations for centuries of injustice are morally required if the poverty that too many black citizens still find themselves mired is ever going to be dealt with.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Antitrust</b><br><br>
							
							
							Companies that are left to their own devices will inevitably begin to consolidate and monopolize the markets they operate in. Standard Oil was the first mega-corporate monopoly, and its power was left unchecked for many years. The America of the Gilded Age understood that monopolies had to be reined in and regulated out of existence, which is why the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was passed. 130 years later, and America has forgotten about monopolies. The government has systematically failed to enforce its antitrust regulations, and the fact that fifty major media companies have become five is the largest example of this. AT&T, America's historic monopoly, has already re-acquired most of its former Baby Bells after the 1984 breakup. We must rein in these corporations and start enforcing the Sherman Act again.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Banks</b><br><br>
							
							
							After destroying the economy in the late noughties, banks asked for taxpayer bailouts, and the government gave them whatever they wanted with almost no strings attached. The common man also needed a bailout, but he got shafted. The banks that failed in 2008 are bigger today than they were during their "too big to fail" heyday. Every single one of these large financial institutions should be broken up, have their assets bought up and nationalized, and their executives prosecuted for their roles in the financial crisis. We should also restore the Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933, which would've prevented the behavior that caused the bank failures in the first place, and we should also revitalize the post offices of this nation by implementing basic banking services at every one in this country.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Borders</b><br><br>
							
							
							The United States founded itself on the principle that it was a nation of immigrants. If it's going to stay true to that principle, it cannot enforce the current hostile policy towards immigration that it has at the present time. There is no need for a border wall, or even a border fence. If anything, we should be welcoming people who come to this country in search of a better life. If the United States truly wants to reduce the number of immigrants from Latin America, the first thing it should do is stop its policy of overthrowing Latin American governments for US corporate interests.
						
						</p>

					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Capital Gains</b><br><br>
							
							
							There is absolutely no reason as to why capital gains should be taxed differently from normal income. The capital gains tax should be abolished and the income generated should be taxed at regular income rates.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Civil Rights</b><br><br>
							
							
							The Civil Rights Act of 1964 needs to be amended to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the existing codified protections of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 needs to be fully restored as well.
						
						</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>Climate Change</b><br><br>
							
							
							No other issue will matter if we as a species do not get this under control. The Green New Deal is the largest, most ambitious program we have to combat climate change, and we only have ten years to stop it before it is irreversible. I believe that a program should be in force that would allow car owners to convert their vehicles from petroleum-based to electricity-based propulsion. This should exist in the form of a national trade-in program and a special conversion for classic vehicles. Petroleum engines should be completely banned from the road in ten years. We should also utilize the massive amounts of space in the deserts of the big western states to build massive solar panel installations to power the nation. We should also build houses to have their own electrical grid.
						
						</p>

					<div class="p">
					
						<p>
						
							<b>College</b><br><br>
							
							
							Having any shot at a middle-class living these days requires a college education. I support free public college and university, and I support the cancellation of all student debt. Those who paid it off should be given a rebate as well. Much of what is taught in the college environment should also be brought to the high school environment. In addition to this, we cannot allow the wealthy to continue to insulate themselves from the working class by sending their kids to prestigious private universities, so we should begin the process of eliminating private education in all its elitist forms.

							<b>Corporate Taxation</b><br><br>
							
							
							The British government could put a stop to the global tax avoidance industry tomorrow if it forced its overseas dependencies to enforce British tax laws, but instead, it allows multinational corporations to dodge taxes which cost the nations of the world hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue that could be used for public services. Heavy penalties should be imposed against tax dodgers and the United Kingdom should be condemned on the world stage for allowing this to happen.
